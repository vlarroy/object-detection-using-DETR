# Object Detection using DETR (Detection Transformer)

## Overview

This project utilizes **DETR (Detection Transformer)**, an advanced object detection model that combines the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with transformers to accurately detect and classify objects in images. The project demonstrates how to use DETR to detect objects, visualize the results, and plot the confidence scores for each detected object.

## Project Structure

- `main.ipynb`: The main script in Jupyter Notebook that loads the image, processes it through the DETR model, and displays the results.

- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage examples.
